1. Initialized a local Git repository and pushed to GitHub  
2. Created `dev` and `feature` branches  
3. Performed development in `feature` branch  
4. Opened a Pull Request (PR) from `feature` → `dev`  
5. After testing, opened a PR from `dev` → `main`  
6. Added `.gitignore` and documented the process in `documentation.md`  
7. Created a Git tag **v1.0** for versioning
